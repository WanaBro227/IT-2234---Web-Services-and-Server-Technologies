# Basic JavaScript Operations

This repository contains simple JavaScript programs demonstrating basic operations, loops, and HTML integration with JavaScript.

## Files Overview

### 1. `BasicOperations.js`
This script performs basic arithmetic operations using two variables.
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

#### Output:
```
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2
```

### 2. `Hello.html`
An HTML file that runs JavaScript inside the browser to:
- Print "Hello World" in the console.
- Display an alert with "Hello World".

#### Output:
- Console: `Hello World`
- Alert Box: `Hello World`

### 3. `loops.js`
This script demonstrates loops and number manipulations:
- Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
- Printing odd numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.
- Printing numbers in reverse order.
- A unique logic to reverse numbers on the left and right.

#### Output:
```
Numbers from 1 to 10 ->
