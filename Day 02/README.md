# JavaScript Exercises

This repository contains JavaScript programs covering arrays, loops, JSON handling, and problem-solving exercises.

## Files Overview

### 1. `Array.js`
Demonstrates array operations:
- Printing array elements using `for` and `forEach` loops.
- Handling nested arrays.
- Performing push and pop operations.
- Working with JSON objects and arrays.

#### Output Example:
```
Arrays.... -->
Using for loop ->
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
...
```

### 2. `Question1.js`
Finds the maximum number in an array using a `forEach` loop.

#### Output Example:
```
Maximum number is = 10
```

### 3. `Question2.js`
Finds common elements between two arrays.

#### Output Example:
```
Common elements between a and b: 3,5
```

### 4. `Question3.js`
Finds all pairs in an array that sum up to a target value.

#### Output Example:
```
1. 1, 6
2. 2, 5
3. 3, 4
```

### 5. `Question4.js`
Finds the most frequent element in an array.

#### Output Example:
```
4
```

### 6. `Question5.js`
Reverses an array using push and pop operations.

#### Output Example:
```
Rearranged array in reverse order = d,c,b,a
```

### 7. `Question6.js`
Handles JSON operations:
- Stores 10 students in an array.
- Filters female students.
- Finds IT students.
- Determines max and average GPA.

#### Output Example:
```
Female Students ->
{regno: "2021/ICT/35", sex: "Female", course: "IT", gpa: 3.7}
...
Average GPA of Students: 2.95
```
